AS OF MAY 31, 2023
	fix the error on the data inserted in attendance form [add id in the query, 
		I guess this will solve the problem]


AS OF MAY 29, 2023
	implement user controls in student form [2023-05-29 -> done]
	sort the names upon retrieving them on attendance form.
	update the 'total absent' and 'total present' in the database [2023-05-29 -> done]
	get the 'total_present' and 'total_absent' and set_text them on the
		user control.


AS OF MAY 25, 2023
	store the result of the buttons, if red -> absent, otherwise,
		present [done]


AS OF MAY 23, 2023
	get the values at a certain column in database
		and store those data in an array list :) [done]
	plan on how to store the count of absences from
		in database. [done]


AS OF MAY 17, 2023
	make the functionalities of each form more concise
		ex. delete class 


AS OF MAY 16, 2023

	get the total number of students in a database.
	generate buttons programatically [dynamically], the 
		number of buttons is based on the number of 
		students in the database. [done]
	set on-click listener on the buttons that are generated [done]
	the solution I think is that, we are going the generate
		a seat plan based on the last names of the students.
		In the future, we are going to make it possible that
		the  teacher is the one who are going the arrange the
		seat plan
